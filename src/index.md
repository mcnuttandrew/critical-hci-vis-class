title: "Critical VIS+HCI"
layout: "base.html"
---

This course aims to equip students with skills for critically analyzing data and data related systems in the context of human-computer interaction (HCI) and visualization research, as well as in computer science more broadly. Via readings, projects, and discussions students will develop conceptual tools for evaluating, interpreting, and critiquing data, interfaces, and systemsâ€”critical thinking in data writ large.

Relevant questions include: what is data? How do we evaluate the quality and relevance of systems for interacting with data? What biases might be inherent in these designs? To serve this goal we will explore perspectives from critical theory, science and technology studies, and HCI/VIS research (such as Data Feminism). Students will gain experience in reading, understanding, and applying ideas from other fields to problems in familiar data domains.

Learning objectives:

- Critical thinking: at the end of the course students should feel comfortable applying a variety of theoretical lenses to data and data systems.
- Communication: students will be able to communicate their ideas in a variety of formats

For each class there will be some assigned reading that you should do before class. Classes will involve discussions of the readings, so it is important that you do the readings.

# Mechanics

This course is populated by a collection of optional assignments. Each assignment is worth some number of points. To get additional details about different activities you might do, see below. Note that this means there is not a notion of late work in this course. **All course work must be turn in by the last day of class before finals.**

Roughly the breakdown of points is as follows

- A: 18-20 points
- B: 15-17 points
- C: 12-14 points
- D: 9-11 points
- F: 0-8 points

Depending on how everyone does there may be a curve. The course staff will not know what the curve is until the end of the semester.

**Possible works**:

(Note: these point values are works in progress)

{% for assignment in collections.assignments %}

- **{{assignment.data.title}} ({{assignment.data.weight}} point):**{{assignment.content}}

{% endfor %}

Other works are allowed, ask ahead (e.g., a video essay, a podcast, a poster). An appropriate way to ask would be to post on the course forum (so that others can see as well), you'll get a response.

There are many different paths through this course. You might write responses for all of the readings (x points), do a project (y points), and write an essay. Or you might write 5 essays! There are many possible approaches.

**Notes and clarifications**

It is possible that you could do nothing all semester and turn a whole bunch of work at once. This is allowed, but discouraged. Much in the same way that judges give harsher verdicts before lunch, requiring that the course staff grade a huge amount of submissions during finals week will likely lead to harsher grading. There is then, a game theory component to this system: when should you submit so that the grading system is currently least overwhelmed?

Similarly it is possible that you could not show all semester or engage with class discussion, that is, generally not be a good citizen of the course. There will be a negative penalty for this: **-5 points (a quarter of the grade)**.

Resubmissions of previous works for new grades is allowed and encouraged. They will not increase your point total, but will allow you to increase the score on your original work.

Given the variety of different types of works, there are a variety of different types of grading that are appropriate and necessary. Under cutting these are a general policy that you should not be disappointing. There are many ways to be disappointing. For instance, using an AI to generate an essay will be looked upon extremely negatively.

Collaborations are allowed depending on the work. For instance, a group project is allowed and points not split, but submitting an interesting paper as a group is not. The course staff must be informed of the collaboration before the work is turned in. If the collaboration is not disclosed, the work will be considered a violation of the academic honesty policy.
