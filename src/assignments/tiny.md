**Respond to something we've read!** This is something you should be doing for everything you read anyway, so you might as well get credit. No credit for obvious AI generated responses. This is the only assignment with a deadline, it must be turned in before the class.

**Make a plan!** This course has a very loose structure that can make it easy to get lost. Write down a plan in a markdown file of what assignments you plan to do and when. This isn't binding, but it's a good idea to have a plan. **This is a required assignment**
