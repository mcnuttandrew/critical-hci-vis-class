**Make a project!** This is the most traditional form work in this course. Here you will propose a project (at least a month in advance of your submission of that project) for which you will receive feedback and approval. The project should be a substantial piece of work that is related to the course topic.

**Take a test!** If you have found yourself in dire need of points a final can be arranged in order to fill up the gap. This will be an in class exam that will cover material from the course, including free response and multiple choice.
