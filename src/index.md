This course aims to equip students with skills for critically analyzing data and data-related systems in the context of human-computer interaction (HCI) and visualization research, as well as in computer science more broadly. Via readings, projects, and discussions students will develop conceptual tools for evaluating, interpreting, and critiquing data, interfaces, and systems—critical thinking in data writ large.

Relevant questions include: what is data? How do we evaluate the quality and relevance of systems for interacting with data? What biases might be inherent in these designs? To serve this goal we will explore perspectives from critical theory, science and technology studies, and HCI/VIS research (such as Data Feminism). Students will gain experience reading, understanding, and applying ideas from other fields to problems in familiar data domains.

Learning objectives:

- **Critical thinking**: at the end of the course students should feel comfortable applying a variety of theoretical lenses to data and data systems.
- **Communication**: at the end of the course students will be able to communicate and synthesize their ideas in a variety of formats
- **Theory**: at the end of the course students will be able to describe the content of a variety of theoretical perspectives and apply them to data and data systems.

Mechanically, the course is essentially a scavenger hunt with a small handful of requirements (showing up to class / being a good citizen/some other minor stuff) wherein you strive to get a certain number of points by the end (25 for the grad version, 20 for the undergrad version). There are a variety of different types of works that you can do to get points, such as an essay or a project. It is up to you how you decide to approach this course. (Except for the required activities, that constitutes 5 points and is not available any other way) Thus there is a more mechanical learning objective of pushing students to deal effectively with time management.

# Mechanics

This course is populated by a collection of optional assignments. Each assignment is worth some number of points. To get additional details about different activities you might do, see below. Note that this means there is not a notion of late work in this course. **All coursework must be turned in by the last day of class before finals.**

Depending on how everyone does there may be a curve. The course staff will not know what the curve is until the end of the semester.

## Possible works

There are many different paths through this course. You might write responses for all of the readings, do a project, and write an essay. Or you might write 5 essays! There are many possible approaches. Other works are allowed, but you must ask ahead. Unusual approaches and welcomed and (for now) encouraged. These might include a video essay, a podcast, a poster, or something else! An appropriate way to ask would be to post on the course forum (so that others can see as well), you'll get a response. **Note, that merely submitting a work is not enough to get all of the points associated with that format, it will also be graded.**

### **Large** (8 points)

**Make a project!** This is the most traditional form of work in this course. Here you will propose a project (at least a month in advance of your submission of that project) for which you will receive feedback and approval. The project should be a substantial piece of work that is related to the course topic.

**Take a test!** If you have found yourself in dire need of points a final can be arranged in order to fill up the gap. This will be a timed exam held towards the end of the course that will cover material from the course, including free response, multiple choice, among other formats.

### **Medium** (4 points)

**Write an essay!** Write an essay about something related to the course. Relevant topics might include a reflection on a topic relevant to your domain knowledge or research, a synthesis related to course readings (although you should anticipate bringing in outside sources as well), a critique of a system or interface using one of our tools, or another appropriate topic (feel free to ask). This should be an academic essay and so refs should be used as appropriate. Think, 2-3 pages in IEEE VIS format (like a poster abstract length).

**Do a talk!** Here you'll do a presentation about something related to the course during class time. You must give at least a 1 week advance notice. Some possible presentations include: a discussion of a paper we did not read during class, an analysis of a system, an argument synthesizing multiple different perspectives we've considered. As part of your request for doing a talk, please file a pull request against this page using the github.

### **Small** (1 points)

**Draw a postcard!** Make a visual representation of a paper we've read. This can be a short lightweight visual abstract or some more in-depth. Use both sides. It should be enlightening to read.

**Help the course!** Suggest a reading not currently covered by the syllabus. If it is sufficiently interesting, we'll bring it into the course. Credit will only given for readings that are used in the course. To help the course file an issue on the github, if you get credit I'll enter it into your submissions.

## Required Activities (5 points)

**Respond to the reading** This is something you should be doing for everything you read anyway, so you might as well get credit. No credit for obvious AI generated responses. This is the only assignment with a deadline, it must be turned in digitally at least an hour before class. These can not be made up.

**Show up to class**

**Make a plan!** This course has a very loose structure that can make it easy to get lost. Write down a plan in a markdown file of what assignments you plan to do and when. This isn't binding, but it's a good idea to have a plan.

## Notes and clarifications

It is possible that you could do nothing all semester and turn a whole bunch of work at once. This is allowed, but discouraged. Much in the same way that judges supposedly give harsher verdicts before lunch, requiring that the course staff grade a huge amount of submissions during finals week will likely lead to harsher grading. There is then, a game theory component to this system: when should you submit so that the grading system is currently least overwhelmed?

Similarly, it is possible that you could not show up all semester or engage with the class discussions, that is, generally not be a good citizen of the course. There will be a negative penalty for this or similar actions: **up to -12 points**. The scope of this penalty will be dependent on the severity of the infraction.

Resubmissions of previous works for new grades is allowed and encouraged. They will not increase your point total, but will allow you to increase the score on your original work. Note: all course work is graded at discretion---submitting something numerous times does not mean it will be graded numerous times.

Given the variety of different types of works, there are a variety of different types of grading that are appropriate and necessary. Undercutting these are a general policy that you should not be disappointing. There are many ways to be disappointing. For instance, using an AI to generate an essay will be looked upon extremely negatively. Depending on the specifics of the infringement this may lead into our academic honesty policy. Submissions that appear to be AI produced can be rejected as ungradably not following instructions.

Collaborations are allowed depending on the work. For instance, a group project is allowed and points are not split, but submitting an interesting paper as a group is not. The course staff must be informed of the collaboration before the work is turned in. If the collaboration is not disclosed, the work will be considered a violation of the academic honesty policy.

Note that because this course structure is experimental, components of it liable to change as the utility/non-utility of them becomes more apparent. For instance, depending on student engagement reading requirements may shift from a point value into a credit gate---such that credit for any assignment is unavailable without having done all the readings. Similarly, the maximum point value may increase or decrease.

# Policies

Behavior during class activities All students are expected to maintain professional behavior, according to [the University of Utah Student Code](www.regulations.utah.edu/academics/guides/students/studentRights.html). Students should read the Code carefully and know that they are responsible for the content. According to Faculty Rules and Regulations, it is the faculty's responsibility to enforce responsible classroom behaviors, beginning with verbal warnings and progressing to dismissal from class and a failing grade. Students have the right to appeal such action to the Student Behavior Committee.

Cheating is taken very seriously and students must be careful not to collaborate on assignments unless otherwise noted. Submissions are routinely checked by the course staff for signs of unauthorized collaboration. Any student found cheating will fail the entire course. We will adhere by the School of Computing policy on academic misconduct.

Note: self-plagiarism is plagiarism, turning in work completed in other courses is viewed as plagiarism. Similarly, using AI tooling for text generation is considered plagiarism.

In cases where projects involve human subjects, mistreatment of those subjects (such as by not following the tenets of the [Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/index.html)) will be viewed as academic misconduct.

College of Engineering guidelines For information on withdrawing from courses, appealing grades, and more, see the [College of Engineering guidelines](https://www.coe.utah.edu/students/academic-affairs/academics/semester-guidelines/).

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture.

We also expect students to treat everyone in the class (including the teaching staff) in a respectful manner.

Student names & personal pronouns Class rosters are provided to the staff with the student's legal name as well as "Preferred first name" (if previously entered by you in the Student Profile section of your CIS account). Please advise the staff of any name or pronoun changes (and update CIS) so we can help create a learning environment in which you feel respected. If you need assistance getting your preferred name on your UID card, please visit the LGBT Resource Center Room 409 in the Olpin Union Building, or email bpeacock@sa.utah.edu to schedule a time to drop by. The LGBT Resource Center hours are M-F 8am-5pm, and 8am-6pm on Tuesdays.

NOTE: This syllabus is meant to serve as an outline and guide for our course. The staff may modify it with reasonable notice to you. The staff may also modify the course schedule to accommodate the needs of our class. Any changes will be announced in class and noted via email.

# Credits

This course is indebted to wide variety of people for this work, their teaching, and their thoughtful commentary. [Miriah Meyer's course](https://miriah.github.io/teaching/cs7960-paradigms/) on a related topic of HCI paradigms was a large inspiration. [Derya Akababa](https://gotdairyya.github.io/) provided some very useful and inspiring commentary.
The course structure draws on a course I heard about taught at Reed College by Troy Cross, but it is not impossible in the intervening years the details have telephoned their way into being something different.
