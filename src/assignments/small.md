**Help the course!** Suggest a reading not currently covered by the syllabus that is sufficiently interesting that we bring it into the course. Note that spamming this assignment may looked upon negatively.

**Draw a postcard!** Make a visual representation of a paper we've read. This can be a short lightweight visual abstract or some more in-depth. Use both sides. It should be enlightening to read.
