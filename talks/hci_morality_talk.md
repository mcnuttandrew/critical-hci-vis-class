I would like to give a talk titled:
## I am not evil, I am just incompetent: Exploring morality and villainry in terms to HCI 

Throughout our course, we have seen how viz can be used to bend the truth, and push narratives. This implores a discussion around what "ethics, morality and villainry" would look like regarding HCI. I would like to talk about what manipulation looks like, what ethical considerations are to be accounted for, and most importantly, where does the liability of misuse of these systems lie. 

some resources that were shared:
1. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.06007
2. Ethical Dimensions of Visualization Research

I'd like to do this talk on 15 April, which is an assorted topics lecture day
